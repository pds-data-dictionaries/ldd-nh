New Horizons Mission Namespace Outline
##################################################

*<nh:Mission_Parameters>* is the public entry point to the New Horizons Mission 
namespace. This class contains all other NH classes and must be included to gain
access to them. Below is a summary outline of all classes and attributes 
currently available in the NH mission dictionary, in the order in which they 
would appear in a label if every single one was used. 

Note that there are no real cases in which every single mission class and 
attribute would appear in a single label. The point of this outline is primarily
to catalog what is present and show the required ordering within classes when
they are included in a label.
