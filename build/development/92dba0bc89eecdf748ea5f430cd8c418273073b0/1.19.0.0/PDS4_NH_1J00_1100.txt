      === Version 1.1.0.0 ===
      
      2024-04-03 to 2024-04-05  Version 1.1.0 continued updates:
             ACR    Deprecate MVIC_Conversion_Constants class in favor of
                    Radiometric_Conversion_Constants class, with corresponding
                    Schematron rule.
                    Consistently add "nh:" prefix to references in descriptions.
                    Review definitions for completeness, consistency, and style;
                      flag problems.
      2024-06-15  ACR  Manually resolved conflicts resulting from multiple people editing
                       the the same parts of the file in separate branches.
                       Convert all occurrences of the name to "Alice".
                       Split "scan_type" attribute definition into two occurences, one for
                       MVIC and one for LEISA, to accommodate different permissible value
                       lists.
                       Modified LEISA_Details class definition to not refer to "channels".

The apID is used in formulating the file name, among other things. Metadata encoded in the apID is contained in separate metadata elements elsewhere in the label.

   name                   units_of_conversion_constants
   version                1.19
   value data type        ASCII_Short_String_Collapsed
   description             The calibrated data are not converted to physical units, because the conversion applied depends on the general spectrum of the object being converted and whether it is resolved. For resolved sources, the conversion produces data in units of radiance. For unresolved sources, the conversion results in units of flux (irradiance). The nh:units_of_conversion_constants attribute contains the appropriate physical units for the conversion constants in the class in which it is contained to produce either radiance or flux units, as appropriate, when the conversion is applied. A description of how to convert from data values to physical units is provided in the "New Horizons SOC to Instrument Pipeline ICD" document.

   description             The nh:Frame_Bias_Levels class records the frame number and left/right bias levels for a single frame in a framing observation sequence. In the MVIC detector used for framing observations, the bias level for left and right sides of the detector may vary. Bias levels on each side are measured with every observation through shielded pixels on either side of the detector, the bias values for the pixels from each side them being averaged to return a single median bias level for each side of the detector. These bias levels are reported as left and right median bias levels for each frame.
