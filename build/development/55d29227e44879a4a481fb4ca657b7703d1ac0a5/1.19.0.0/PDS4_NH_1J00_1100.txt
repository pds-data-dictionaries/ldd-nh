   description             The calibrated data are not converted to physical units, because the conversion applied depends on the general spectrum of the object being converted and whether it is resolved. For resolved sources, the conversion produces data in units of radiance. For unresolved sources, the conversion results in units of flux (irradiance). This attribute contains the appropriate physical units for the conversion constants in the class in which it is contained to produce either radiance or flux units, as appropriate, when the conversion is applied. A description of how to convert from data values to physical units is provided in the "New Horizons SOC to Instrument Pipeline ICD" document.

   name                   Frame_Bias_Levels
   description             The Frame_Bias_Levels class records the frame number and left/right bias levels for a single frame in a framing observation sequence. In the MVIC detector used for framing observations, the bias level for left and right sides of the detector may vary. Bias levels on each side are measured with every observation through shielded pixels on either side of the detector, the bias values for the pixels from each side them being averaged to return a single median bias level for each side of the detector. These bias levels are reported as left and right median bias levels for each frame.
