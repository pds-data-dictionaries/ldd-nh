    and SWRI (NH second extended mission). Async releases are anticipated to 
    keep the published dictionary in line with published data.

    Modification History:
    
      2024-04-03  ACR  Begin history
      
      === Version 1.2.0.0
      
      2024-11-26   ACR  Removed (well, commented out) unused class LORRI_Target_Information and its three
                        attributes. There were issues with the attribute descriptions in any event, 
                        misconstruing the use of xsi:nil and instructing users to insert "UNK" as a value
                        for target name, which is not appropriate. If target pixel location is desired,
                        recommend we determine it precisedly via SPICE and convert to pixel location.
      2025-01-09   ACR  Changed minOccurs for nh:Observation_Parameters in nh:Mission_Parameters to zero
                        (i.e., made it optional). No test added for when it should be used largely 
                        because for migration the templates will already include the optional class
                        everywhere it makes sense.
                        Changed minOccirs for nh:Spacecraft_State in nh:Observation_Parameters to zero
                        and added note in definition that if the class has no relevant attributes, it 
                        should be omitted entirely.
      2025-01-10   ACR  Changed detector_name value for SWAP and added rule to flag the old value as 
                        no longer acceptable.
      2025-01-28   ACR  Corrected minor typos in spelling, punctuation, etc. as they were noted in 
                        passing.
      2025-02-15   ACR  o Deprecated pointing_method 
                        o Updated: frame_data_source definition, gc_scan_rate, target_motion_rate, 
                          radiometry_response_offset 
                        o Set max/min for target_motion_rate on appropriate range, which is 
                          1-1100 microrad/s, but will appear in labels with units of rad/s (so
                          0.000001-0.0011 rad/s).
                        o Removed "[CHECK]" remark from radio_bandwidth
                        o Completed NH/KEM1/KEM2 mission_phase_name value list.
                        o Modified definition of agc_gain_provenance to replace reference to non-existent
                          permissible value in agc_setting_source to the correct permissible value. Replaced
                          references to "ULDB" acronym with "uplink database" in agc_setting_source.
                        o Expanded "TDI" acronym in error messages and definitions.
                        o Clarified the English in the "check_bias" DD_Rule.
                        o Added Internal_Reference to SOC Instrument ICD document to REX attribute 
                          definitions that quoted the power equation in the definitions and did not
                          already have such a reference. Also added reference to ICD document name in
                          definition.
                        o Modified the definition of time_tag_calibration_constant based on an email
                          conversation and reference to the REX chapter of the ICD.
                        o Updated definition of Radiometric_Conversion_Constants class to explicitly state
                          that it appears in both MVIC and LORRI data.
                        o Added door_position attribute to Alice_Details class. It is technically optional
                          to avoid a non-backwards compatible change, but it should always be present.
      
      === Version 1.1.0.0 ===
      
      2024-04-03 to 2024-04-05  Version 1.1.0 continued updates:
             ACR    Deprecate MVIC_Conversion_Constants class in favor of
                    Radiometric_Conversion_Constants class, with corresponding
                    Schematron rule.
                    Consistently add "nh:" prefix to references in descriptions.
                    Review definitions for completeness, consistency, and style;
                      flag problems.
      2024-06-15  ACR  Manually resolved conflicts resulting from multiple people editing
                       the the same parts of the file in separate branches.
                       Convert all occurrences of the name to "Alice".
                       Split "scan_type" attribute definition into two occurences, one for
                       MVIC and one for LEISA, to accommodate different permissible value
                       lists.
                       Modified LEISA_Details class definition to not refer to "channels".
      
      2024-06-20       Added schematron rule to enforce correct units for resolved vs.
          cgobat       unresolved sources in nh:units_of_conversion_constants; updated
                       several attribute descriptions and removed [INCOMPLETE] and [CHECK]
                       flags; removed "Spectrograph" as a permissible value for
                       nh:detector_type; added a minimum value of absolute zero for LEISA
                       temperature attribute; added the SOCC to the list of permissible
                       Alice aperture values; removed nh:binning_mode attribute and its
                       parent class nh:LORRI_Details (of which it was the only member).

   description             The calibrated data are not converted to physical units, because the conversion applied depends on the general spectrum of the object being converted and whether it is resolved. For resolved sources, the conversion produces data in units of radiance. For unresolved sources, the conversion results in units of flux (irradiance). The nh:units_of_conversion_constants attribute contains the appropriate physical units for the conversion constants in the class in which it is contained to produce either radiance or flux units, as appropriate, when the conversion is applied. A description of how to convert from data values to physical units is provided in the "New Horizons SOC to Instrument Pipeline ICD" document.
